This cutting-edge project pioneers the realm of image animation through the utilization of 
advanced deep learning techniques, specifically focusing on conditional generative models such 
as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). By training 
on meticulously curated datasets containing pairs of images and their corresponding sequences, 
these models are adept at transforming static images into dynamic and cohesive animations, 
imbuing them with lifelike movements and transformations
