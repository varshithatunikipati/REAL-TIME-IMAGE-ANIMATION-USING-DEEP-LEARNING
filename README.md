An image animation project involves creating a sequence of images that are displayed in rapid succession to give the illusion of movement. This can be achieved through various animation techniques such as 2D vector-based animation, 3D animation, or traditional hand-drawn animation. The project typically starts with a concept or story, followed by the creation of a storyboard, which lays out the sequence of images and actions. Then, animators create the images and animate them according to the storyboard. Finally, the animated sequence is edited and synchronized with sound effects and music to complete the project.
